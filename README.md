This project aims to maintain a comprehensive database of all lexical and morphological information for the New Ithkuilic Language. It may eventually expand to include morpho-phonology. Sources for this information can be found in PDFs posted by /u/zeuhl59 on the [Ithkuil subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Ithkuil).

Current status:

* [ ] Roots: not started
